Simplify test set selection. Currently, we need to go through the following steps:

- List up all annotated variant sets
- Decide which one is used as a negative training set and remove it from the list, so it is not included in the full training set
- Use the remaining variants sets to build the full training set
 -Check that none of the variants in the test set are still present in the training set. If there are some, remove them from the training set.
- Extract validation set from the training set and if there are still variants in the training set that overlap with the validation set, remove them from the training set.

Automate the process, so that we need to only give the vector containing tissues that are to be used as test sets. - Done

- Add VCF annotation and prediction workflow
- Add indel functionality
- Re-tune the model
- Remove seeding during annotation, when building negative training set
- Select negative DNase variants from the specific tissue (same as positive variants)
- Look at the effect of negative set ratios on the model performance
- Package into a Docker
